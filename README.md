### 📝 **Project Title**

  **Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to uncover meaningful insights into survival patterns.


 📊 **Objectives**

* Clean missing or inconsistent data
* Analyze relationships between features (age, gender, class, fare)
* Visualize patterns and survival rates
* Interpret correlation between numerical features


🔧 **Tools Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Google Colab


### 🔍 **Key Insights**

* Passengers in **1st class** were more likely to survive.
* **Women** had a much higher survival rate than men.
* Higher **fare** had a positive relation with survival.
* **Younger passengers** had slightly better survival chances.
* `Cabin` was dropped due to excessive missing values.
